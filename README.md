# 🧩 MERN CRUD App

> A simple yet slick CRUD application built with **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React**, and **Node.js** — styled with **TailwindCSS** because we like looking good while doing good.  

This project demonstrates full-stack CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with a clean codebase, reusable components, and zero TypeScript — because sometimes, **types are just visual noise** 😏
